# NotFingerprint Spoofing
Gradual implementation of different shallow machine learning algorithms and techniques, with the goal of detecting fake fingerprints (or better, a very small sets of features extracted from a fingerprints dataset). The project was conducted as an assignement for the 2024 Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition course at PoliTO.

Results for each lab can be found in `LabX_report.docx` inside each lab folder.  

Because of the gradual implementation, done week-by-week, there isn't a specific file to refer to.  
The most important logic of the application can be found in the `modules` folder present in each `lab` folder. They contain functions and classes that implement or are useful for the different ML models.  
If some code seems to be broken, that is because I had to modify really few functions real quick in order to obtain results that were asked at the last laboratories, still, I believe that the code can still be interpreted, especially when comparing it with the different version of the different labs.
